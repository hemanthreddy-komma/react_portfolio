## How to Host on GitHub Pages

If you want to host your own React app on GitHub Pages, here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.
2. Click on the **+** icon at the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Name your repository (e.g., `my-portfolio`), add a description (optional), and choose **Public**.
4. Click **Create repository**.

### Step 2: Set up Your React App

1. **Create a React app** (if you haven’t already):

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-portfolio
   cd my-portfolio

### Step 3: Install GitHub Pages Package

1. In your React app’s root directory, install the gh-pages package:
   ```bash
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev

### Step 4: Configure package.json
1. Open your package.json file and add the following two fields:
 - homepage: This specifies the URL where the app will be hosted.
   
  ```bash
  "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name",
```
- scripts: Add the following deploy and predeploy scripts:
  ```bash
  "scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"}
  ```
 - Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-repository-name with the name of the repository you created in Step 1.

### Step 5: Deploy Your App

1. In the root directory of your app, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
- This will create a build folder and push the contents to the gh-pages branch of your GitHub repository.
  
### Step 6: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to Settings > Pages (on the left sidebar).
3. Under the Source section, select the gh-pages branch and save.
4. Your site should now be live at https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name.

### Step 7: Done!
Your React app is now hosted on GitHub Pages. You can visit the live demo and share it with others!
